# son-editor [![Build Status](http://jenkins.sonata-nfv.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=son-editor)](http://jenkins.sonata-nfv.eu/job/son-editor/)

For the SONATA editor we envision an Eclipse or IntelliJ plugin that supports function and service developers. This, however, is our vision on the long run. For now, this repository contains some Java libraries and tools that validate SONATA descriptors using the SONATA schema.

## Development

To contribute to the development of the SONATA editor, you may use the very same development workflow as for any other SONATA Github project. That is, you have to fork the repository and create pull requests.

#### Contributing

You may contribute to the editor similar to other SONATA (sub-) projects, i.e. by creating pull requests.
