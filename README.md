# son-editor [![Build Status](http://jenkins.sonata-nfv.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=son-editor)](http://jenkins.sonata-nfv.eu/job/son-editor/)

For the SONATA editor we envision a Eclipse or IntelliJ plugin that supports function and service developers. This, however, is our vision on the long run. For now, this repository contains some Java libraries and tools that validate SONATA descriptors using the SONATA schema.

## Development

To contribute to the development of the SONATA editor, you may use the very same development workflow as for any other SONATA Github project. That is, you have to fork the repository and create pull requests. Moreover, all discussions regarding the SONATA schemas take place on Github, and NOT on the wiki.

#### Contributing

You may contribute to the schema files similar to other SONATA (sub-) projects, i.e. by creating pull requests. However, since changes in the schema file may affect several other tools and projects, the pull requests might be discussed on the mailing list before it is merged to the master branch.

The following lead developers are responsible for this repository and have admin rights. They can, for example, merge pull requests.

#### License

The license of the SONATA editor is BSD for now. However, we intend to change it to Apache 2.0 later.
